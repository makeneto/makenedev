        question: 'What inspired me to code?',
        answer: 'Well, my older brother, <a href="https://nublson.com" target="_blank">Nubelson</a> 🐏, has inspired me a lot and continues to inspire me every day to become a better programmer. Since an early age, he has been my idol and the person I admire the most, both inside and outside the programming world. He has also supported me greatly in my academic development and my career as a programmer.'

        question: 'What was my toughest project?',
        answer: 'Hmm, great question... The most challenging project I have ever completed was the GYMak Database, a system for managing gym athletes, monthly budgets, and many other innovative and useful features. I presented it to a gym, but it didn’t succeed due to a lack of resources to support the system, such as a computer, and... let’s say, a lack of interest as well.'

    {
        question: 'What was my first project like?',
        answer: 'I remember it like it was yesterday! I created a VLSM calculation tool. VLSM allows subnetting with different sizes to optimize IP usage. It’s like cutting a Wi-Fi cake into slices of the right size for each guest, without wasting or running out of pieces! 🎂📡 In my class, or maybe even in my school, students in the IT field struggled to learn how to perform these calculations. So, I came up with the idea of creating a calculator to simplify this process, which I called VLSM Calculator. This later led to another project: the IP Calculator, which helps users calculate and analyze IP addresses, making network configuration and understanding much easier.'

        question: 'What are my career goals?',
        answer: 'My career goals... hmm 💭🤔 Without a doubt, I want to work in a fun and promising environment, where I can collaborate harmoniously with my team, exchange knowledge, contribute to amazing projects, have a peaceful life, and build a successful career.'

        question: 'What’s my favorite language?',
        answer: 'I really enjoy using JavaScript because it’s the language I identify with the most and have truly dedicated myself to learning. I love its libraries and frameworks. ❤️☕'
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I learn new languages?',
        answer: 'First, I clearly define my goals. I like to work in stages, follow a structured path, explore the technology I’m learning in depth, be curious (dive deeper), and practice everything I learn to solidify my knowledge and make sure nothing is left behind.👌👌'

    {
        question: 'How do I design intuitive UIs?',
        answer: 'Well, whenever I design a new interface, I don’t think much like a developer—I put myself in the user’s shoes instead. I ask myself questions like, "If I were the user, would I enjoy navigating this page?" I follow design principles, carefully manage colors, layout, and responsiveness, and ensure the interface is as user-friendly as possible.'
